# Cat Clicker - a lesson about Design Patters

### Synopsis	

In Cat Clicker you will build a very basic program where a user can click the image of a cute cat. The clicks will be counted and the user will see, how often he clicked the image.

What starts as a simple five minute program will get more complicated soon enough. The specs of our Cat Clicker will change very fast. First we have two cats and then five, making coding more and more repetitive, producing chunks of ugly spaghetti code.

In order to clean up your code you have to separate data, data manipulation and view, by implementing your own fictional MVO(Model-View-Object Design Pattern), called Model-View-Octopus(sounds weird, but Larry the octopus will teach you a lot about data handling and MVO's in general). This coding step is a preparation for Knockout.js and Backbone.js
